# Bi_analyst-R-project
In this project, I demostrate how to predict missing value in data set.
The R coding was performed  Knitr E Markdown and  the UI employed Shiny_Dashboard.

Methodology involved the use of Neural network for time-series prediciton

Possible use_case can be found in fraud detection given  some transactional data.
