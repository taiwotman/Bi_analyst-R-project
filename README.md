# Bi_analyst-R-project
In this project, I demostrate how to predict missing value in data set.
This was done using R Markdown and  the UI was displayed in Shiny_Dashboard

Methodology: Use Neural network based on intrapolation and extrapolation prediction of missing value 
in a data set.

Possible use_case can be found in fraud detection given  some transactional data.
